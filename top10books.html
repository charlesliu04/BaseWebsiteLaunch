            <h1>1. <em>Educated </em>By Tara Westover</h1> 
            <p>Tara Westover’s memoir is an enthralling journey through a life marked by both heartbreak and triumph. Her storytelling pulls readers into her world, making us feel as though we are living her experiences alongside her. Most of us cannot imagine enduring the challenges she faced, but her narrative uncovers profound stories of resilience, family, faith, and the transformative power of education. It serves as a poignant reminder that while genetics may deal the cards, it is our environment and choices that determine how we play them.</p>

<h1>4.<em> Holy Bible</em> </h1> 
            <p>Before my time at Boston College, spirituality held little place in my life. However, engaging with the scriptures transformed my perspective, infusing my daily existence with newfound purpose and clarity. The wisdom of the Bible, with its rich tapestry of moral lessons, historical narratives, and timeless parables, encouraged me to adopt a more disciplined lifestyle, drawing me closer to the ideals exemplified by Christ. 
                This profound shift was not merely about adhering to religious tenets but about embracing a way of life that prioritizes compassion, humility, and a deep-seated sense of inner peace. 
                The stories and teachings of the Bible have become a cornerstone of my personal growth, shaping my values and guiding my actions in a world that often seems devoid of such depth. </p>

                <h1>5. <em>All of Percy Jacson books and their spin offs </em>By Rick Rioridan </h1> 
                <p>Rick Riordan's Percy Jackson series, along with its spin-offs, has left an indelible mark on my childhood. These books not only entertained me but also instilled a sense of adventure and curiosity about the world and its myths. I wouldn't be who I am today without them.</p>
