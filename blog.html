            <h1><em>Motivation </em></h1> 
            <p>As college students or former college students, we're familiar with the rollercoaster ride of motivation that accompanies each semester.
             We enter with high hopes, envisioning a steady climb of motivation that peaks just in time for finals. 
             However, the reality often unfolds differently—a journey marked by unexpected twists and turns, highs and lows, much like a winding road.</p>
           <h1>The Ideal vs. The Reality</h1>
            <p> In an ideal world, our motivation would only grow stronger with each academic challenge, propelling us towards our goals with unwavering determination.
                 Midterms would be milestones that boost our confidence, setting us up for an even more triumphant finals week.</p>
            <img src="https://github.com/charlesliu04/Website/blob/main/Images/Ideal.png?raw=true" style="width:auto; max-width:400px; height:250px; display:block; margin:0 auto;">
            <p> But the reality is like this:</p>
            <img src="https://github.com/charlesliu04/Website/blob/main/Reality.png?raw=true" style="width:auto; max-width:400px; height:250px; display:block; margin:0 auto;">
            <p>So I always asked myself how can I attain motivation more like the first graph. </p>
            <h1>Our Brain</h1>
            <img src="https://github.com/charlesliu04/Website/blob/main/Former%20brain.png?raw=true" style="width:auto; max-width:400px; height:250px; display:block; margin:0 auto;">
            <p>I hope you guys all recognize this from a ted talk. We have two main players in our brain: our rational decision-maker, guiding us with logic, and an instant gratification monkey, who just wants to do what’s most fun right now. While fun is great, we can't always indulge in it.</p>
            <p>On days when we are happy, motivated, and inspired, we have the ability to fend off our instant gratification monkey and take control. But on days we lack motivation, our rational decision-maker is tired and falling asleep, allowing the instant gratification monkey to excitingly take over.</p>
            
            <h1>The Science of Motivation</h1>
            <p>To combat this, we must turn to the science of our brains. 
                Enter the anterior midcingulate cortex (aMCC), our willpower's command center. The aMCC has the ability to scare off the instant gratification monkey, so
                 strengthening the aMCC is key to maintaining motivation, and this is achieved through action—taking on challenges that demand discipline, however small they may seem.</p>
            <img src="https://github.com/charlesliu04/Website/blob/main/Brain.png?raw=true" style="width:auto; max-width:400px; height:250px; display:block; margin:0 auto;">
            <h1>Cultivating Willpower Through Action</h1>
            <p>Engaging in these challenging tasks not only prepares us for future hurdles but also initiates a positive feedback loop. 
                Each action taken strengthens the aMCC, leading to a sense of progress that fuels further motivation. 
                This cycle of action-inspiration-motivation becomes a self-sustaining force that can drive us towards our goals.</p>

            <h1>The Philosophy of Motivation</h1>
            <p>And this isn't something new. Over a century ago, William James, a renowned Harvard psychologist and philosopher, said, "Action seems to follow feeling, but really action and feeling go together; and by regulating the action, which is under the more direct control of the will, we can indirectly regulate the feeling,  which is not.” 
                Modern neuroscience agrees, showing us that our brains respond to our actions by building stronger pathways for discipline.
            <h1>Embracing Action</h1>
             <p>In the end, the essence of motivation is a series of choices. Each time you choose action over inaction, you're not just moving closer to your goals; you're shaping the very structure of your brain, and creating motivation. It's not about waiting for inspiration; it's about being the architect of your own motivation. Remember that motivation is not an external force it is inside each of us.
